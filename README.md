## Description

This employee tracker uses mySQL and Inquirer to complete a comprehensive list of employees, management, and various roles and departments within a company. The tables are structured such that departments, roles, and employees each have their own table, but are connected through each employee's role ID, which corresponds to respective department IDs. Every component is entered through an Inquirer prompt by the user. The user is able to Add and Delete departments, roles, and employees, as well as updating employee roles or managers. THere is also the option to view each table, (Departments, Roles, and Employees) along with a manager table that displays the manager and their team, or a department table which displays all employees in each department. Users may also store data in a seed file and source that into the employee database.
